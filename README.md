# Group-Hackathon
This hackathon involved 4 teams in our bootcamp, with each team working on completely different tasks in the Exploratory Data Analysis in taxi data.

These tasks included encoding, visualization, skewness, and correlation.

Our team, named 'Code Crushers', worked on analysing the correlation between the various features in the marketing sales data.
Some features had strong/positive correlation whilst others had weak/negative correlation.

Our team had to extract correlation values with  marketing sales, and histogram visualizations for numeric values were also created.
