# Group-Hackathon
This hackathon involed 4 teams in our bootcamp, with each team working on completely different tasks in the Exploratory Data Analysis in a taxi data.
These tasks included encoding, visualization, skewness and correlation.
Our team named 'Code Crushers' worked on correlation between the various features in the taxi data.
Some of the features had strong positive correlation, others had weak negative correlation, weak postiive correlation and strong negative correlation.
